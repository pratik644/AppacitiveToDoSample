# Let's Do - A simple to-do application.

## INTRODUCTION

**Let's Do** is a very simple to-do application with minimal functionality built to help you get started with using your Appacitive model in an iOS application. If you have reached here through the wizard from the Appacitive portal, I assume you have already built your mode for the application which means 50% of your work is done. If, for any reason, you have not made a model at Appacitive, I would advise you to first complete that step and come back here and continue. In case if you are not familiar with building your model in Appacitive, I would encourage you to take a look at [this](http://www.vimeo.com/appacitive) page which contains very comprehensive videos on using Appacitive as your back-end.
